# HvZ
HvZ Project for Interactive Media Development
Humans vs Zombies is an RIT event week. In IMD, we were tasked with creating
a similar situation in Unity using autonomous agents with an emphasis on obstacle
avoidance, wandering, seeking, and fleeing. The documentation goes over more of the
project and controls.
